# Comments
#
# [camera]
# internal: in seconds
# file_by_date: store under tmv_root/2020-12-31/
# inactive_threshold: minimum time, in seconds, we'll power down/sleep/etc if camera inactive
# camera_inactive_action:
#   WAIT: just time.sleep()
#   EXCEPTION: raise PowerOff
#   POWER_OFF: ask pijuice to turn off (will wakeup at the right time)
#   EXIT: call system exit
# on:
#   10:00:00 : turn on at this time
#   'dawn'|'sunrise'|'sunset'|'dusk' : calculate based on position on on Earthy
#   'dim'|'light'|'dark' : use the camera as a light sensor to determine this
# off:
#   as for 'on'. Type has to match (e.g. 10:00:00 and 12:12:00 works ok)

#   light   : pixel average above which it is light

#   max_age : the maximum age, in seconds, of light level readings.
#             older readings are discarded
#             to change the level, all recent images must have the same level
#  power_off :
#           if we poweroff via sensor reading (e.g. off = 'Dim'), how long,
#           in seconds, to stay off for?
